# Repository for new/unstable packages

This repository was created primarily to deal with backlog of package requests and preventing appearance of poor quality packages in the main Termux repository.

There much less-restrictive policy on acceptable packages (generally, you can submit everything that builds). Good packages will be a subject for moving to the main Termux repository, however really bad packages will be just deleted.
